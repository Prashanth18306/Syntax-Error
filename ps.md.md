PROBLEM STATEMENT  
In recent times, many students face difficulty in identifying the most suitable domain for 
their career based on their interests, skills, and academic background. Even after 
selecting a domain, students often remain confused about how to begin their prepar ation, 
what skills are required, and the types of companies they should target. This lack of 
structured guidance leads to inefficient preparation, anxiety, and poor decision -making 
during campus placements.  
Additionally, students struggle to understand how well their resumes align with their 
chosen domain and job roles. Many are unaware of their skill gaps, resume weaknesses, 
and readiness level for interviews. Without personalized feedback and adaptive learn ing 
support, students find it difficult to improve their preparation strategy effectively.  
This problem calls for the development of an intelligent, student -centric guidance system 
that helps students identify suitable career domains, analyze resumes, understand skill 
requirements, receive personalized preparation roadmaps, and adapt learning pa ths based 
on individual progress. The goal is to reduce confusion, improve preparation efficiency, 
and enable students to approach placements with clarity and confidence.  
 
FEATURES / SUB -PROBLEMS  
 
SIMPLE LEVEL (5)  
1. Problem  id: S1 
Students cannot easily connect their personal interests and academic background to 
potential career fields, leaving them without clear direction.  
Example:  
A Computer Science student who enjoys graphic design and story writing does not know 
these interests align perfectly with a career in UX/UI Design. They default to applying only 
for generic software developer roles.  
 
2. Problem  id :S2  
Once a domain is chosen, students lack a basic checklist of initial actions, essential 
resources, and a timeline to start their preparation effectively.  
Example:  
A student decides to pursue "Data Science." They spend weeks overwhelmed, unsure if 
they should first learn Python, watch tutorials, enroll in a course, or find datasets to 
practice with, leading to procrastination.  
 
3. Problem  id: S3 
Students have no simple way to get a quick, automated review of their resume's 
formatting, clarity, and basic keyword alignment with their target roles.  
Example:  
A student applies for "Marketing Analyst" roles but their resume is densely formatted, lacks 
quantifiable achievements, and misses key terms like "Google Analytics" or "ROI analysis," 
causing it to be rejected by automated tracking systems (ATS).  
 
4. Problem  id : S4  
There is a lack of centralized, role -specific information on the different types of 
companies (startups, MNCs, etc.) that hire for a student's chosen field.  
Example:  
An Electrical Engineering student targeting "Embedded Systems" roles only knows to apply 
to large electronics manufacturers. They are unaware of exciting opportunities in 
automotive companies (e.g., Tesla), aerospace (ISRO), or IoT startups.  
 
5. Problem  id : S5 
Students cannot benchmark their current preparation level against typical requirements 
for their target roles to gauge their starting point.  
Example:  
A final -year student wants a job in "Consulting." They don't know if their level of case 
practice, guesstimate skills, and business awareness is at a "beginner," "intermediate," or 
"ready -for-interview" stage compared to peers.  
 
MEDIUM LEVEL (3)  
6. Problem  id : M1 
Students struggle to prioritize which specific technical and soft skills to develop from a 
vast list, leading to scattered and shallow learning.  
Example:  
For "Product Management," a student finds recommendations for skills like SQL, A/B 
testing, PRD writing, stakeholder management, and roadmap prioritization. They jump 
randomly between online articles on each topic without mastering any, leaving them 
unprep ared for in -depth interview questions.  
 
7. Problem  id : M2 
Existing guidance is generic and does not adapt to a student's unique learning pace, 
strengths, and weaknesses, making study plans inefficient.  
Example:  
Two students follow the same "8 -week coding interview prep" plan. Student A, who is 
weak in Data Structures but strong in Algorithms, wastes time on algorithm basics. Student 
B, with the opposite profile, struggles because the plan doesn't provide extra da ta 
structure resources when they fail a practice test.  
 
8. Problem  id : M3 
It is difficult for students to translate abstract job descriptions into a concrete, project -
based learning plan that builds a demonstrable portfolio.  
Example:  
A job description for a "Cybersecurity Analyst" requires "understanding of network 
vulnerabilities" and "incident response." A student doesn't know how to turn this into a 
hands -on project, like setting up a safe lab environment to simulate an attack or an alyzing 
sample packet captures.  
 
HARD LEVEL (2)  
9. Problem  id : H1 
The problem requires an AI system that can dynamically map a student's evolving skill 
profile against real -time job market trends to recommend the highest -value learning 
interventions.  
Example:  
In early 2023, a student is preparing for cloud roles. The system analyzes real -time job 
postings and detects a sharp 40% increase in demand for "Azure DevOps" skills compared to 
"AWS Solutions Architect." It dynamically alerts the student and suggests piv oting a portion 
of their study plan to include Azure -specific pipelines and infrastructure -as-code.  
 
10. Problem  id : H2 
The core challenge is creating a closed -loop guidance system that uses continuous 
feedback from mock interviews and project assessments to autonomously adjust a 
student's entire preparation strategy and goals.  
Example:  
A student aiming for "Machine Learning Engineer" roles does well on coding tests but 
consistently receives poor feedback on explaining their project's model trade -offs during 
mock interviews. The system doesn't just note this weakness; it automatically red uces the 
focus on new coding problems and injects a new module on "model interpretability and 
communication," while even suggesting they refine a specific project from their portfolio 
to better showcase this skill.
