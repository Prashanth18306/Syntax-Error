# Rules

Hello everyone,

Some of you have raised questions regarding the problem statements, so here is a detailed clarification.

There are a total of 10 sub-problems, categorized by difficulty level as follows:

- Easy: S1 – S5
- Medium: M1 – M3
- Hard: H1 – H2

You are expected to complete the maximum number of problem statements.

Marks Allocation

- 70 Marks → Based on the number of sub-problems completed and their difficulty level:
  - Easy → Lower weightage
  - Medium → Moderate weightage
  - Hard → Higher weightage

The remaining 30 Marks will be evaluated based on the following:

- 10 Marks → Revenue Generation Explanation
  (How you plan to generate revenue from your solution)

- 10 Marks → UI / Design of the Application

- 10 Marks → Communication & Presentation Skills

So, focus not only on solving the problems but also on presenting your idea, design, and business model effectively.

# Selected Problem Statements

## Problem id: S4 (Easy)
There is a lack of centralized, role-specific information on the different types of companies (startups, MNCs, etc.) that hire for a student's chosen field.
### Example:
An Electrical Engineering student targeting "Embedded Systems" roles only knows to apply to large electronics manufacturers. They are unaware of exciting opportunities in automotive companies (e.g., Tesla), aerospace (ISRO), or IoT startups.

## Problem id: M1 (Medium)
Students struggle to prioritize which specific technical and soft skills to develop from a vast list, leading to scattered and shallow learning.
### Example:
For "Product Management," a student finds recommendations for skills like SQL, A/B testing, PRD writing, stakeholder management, and roadmap prioritization. They jump randomly between online articles on each topic without mastering any, leaving them unprepared for in-depth interview questions.

## Problem id: H2 (Hard)
The core challenge is creating a closed-loop guidance system that uses continuous feedback from mock interviews and project assessments to autonomously adjust a student's entire preparation strategy and goals.
### Example:
A student aiming for "Machine Learning Engineer" roles does well on coding tests but consistently receives poor feedback on explaining their project's model trade-offs during mock interviews. The system doesn't just note this weakness; it automatically reduces the focus on new coding problems and injects a new module on "model interpretability and communication," while even suggesting they refine a specific project from their portfolio to better showcase this skill.
